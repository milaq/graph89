# Graph 89

Graph89 is an emulator targeting the Android platform for TI89, TI89T, TI92, TI92+, V200, TI84+, TI84+SE, TI83, TI83+ and TI83+SE calculators.

This is a continuation of the awesome work done by Dritan Hashorva to bring a bit of UI polish and modern feature enhancements to the project.
It was forked from the [last version distributed by the original author](https://bitbucket.org/dhashoandroid/graph89-paid/).

Kudos to him and everyone involved in the TI emulation projects, especially the TiEmu and TilEm developers.
